# Google Maps Timeline Commute
> Compute commute from Google Maps Location History data

By supplying `Location History.json` from Google Takeout, attempt to compute commute times.

Does not currently work due to Takeout reporting `longitudeE7` nebulously incorrectly. Same issue with `.kml` export. Very strange, couldn't figure out how to convert it appropriately. Tried many permutations of expected calculations.
